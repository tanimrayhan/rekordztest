    <h2>Message from the Developer</h2>


    <p style="margin-top:15px; line-height:1.7; text-align: justify;">

In the vastness of the galaxy, our existence is almost invisible.
Worlds move, stars are born and fade away,
and somewhere within that endless universe,
we are given a very small moment to live.

Strangely enough, that small moment is all we have,
and that is what makes it so valuable.

There will be days when nothing feels important,
days when effort feels pointless,
days when it seems like nothing you do really matters.
And yet, the truth is —
this limited time you carry is the only place
where meaning can ever exist.

You are not here to remain still.
You are not here to waste your energy in doubt.
You are here to grow, to struggle, to learn,
to become someone stronger than yesterday.

Even the smallest step you take today
is a victory against the emptiness of time.

So keep moving.
Keep building.
Keep pushing yourself forward,
not because the universe is watching,
but because this life you have been given is rare.

Do not let your moments fade in silence.
Fill them with effort.
Fill them with courage.
Fill them with purpose.

And most importantly —
stay alive with energy,
stay alive with hope,
and never forget that your story is already written.

<br><br>
